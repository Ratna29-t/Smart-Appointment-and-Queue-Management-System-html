## 🎯 Problem Statement

In many real-world service environments (clinics, salons, banks, government offices), users struggle with:

- Long waiting times without transparency  
- Overcrowded waiting areas and confusion about turn order  
- Anxiety about “How long will this take?”  
- Poor experience for elderly, first-time, or low-tech users  

This project explores how **UX-centered interface design** can make waiting more transparent, predictable, and less stressful.

## 🧠 Solution Overview

The system provides:

- **Simple appointment booking**  
  - Clear “Book Appointment” hero section  
  - Form with name, contact, and preferred time  
  - Primary CTA with strong visual hierarchy  

- **Live queue visibility**  
  - Stats cards: total waiting, your position, estimated wait time  
  - Visual **progress ring** to show your place in the queue  
  - “Now Serving” and “Next in Line” cards for instant clarity  

- **Calm, accessible experience**  
  - Large, legible typography and high contrast for elderly users  
  - Clear token ID and ETA to reduce anxiety  
  - Voice check-in bubble and QR FAB as conceptual accessibility features  

This is a **UI/UX concept** that can later be wired to real APIs or backend systems.
